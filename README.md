# BookBazaar

BookBazaar is a simple agent-based simulation of a marketplace where book sellers set prices and a buyer searches for the best deal. Built using the Mesa framework, this application allows users to observe the interaction between sellers and buyers in a dynamic environment.

## Features

- **Agent-Based Modeling**: Simulates independent sellers who set random book prices and a buyer who searches for the best price.
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Sellers set their prices based on an average price with some randomness.
- **Multiple Iterations**: The model can run for several steps, allowing users to observe how the market evolves over time.

## Installation

To run this application, you'll need Python and Mesa installed. You can install Mesa using pip:

```bash
pip install mesa
